This directory is copied from github.com/xyzisinus/Tango, a fork of
the Autolab project (github.com/autolab).  It's not part of the
grading container but serves as a reference to the operations on the
grading VM.  The grading VM should be Autolab-ready, i.e. capable of
running an Autolab grading job.

If you already have an Autolab-ready grading vm image, you don't need
to be concerned with the files in this directory.  Otherwise please
read on.

To key to being an Autolab-ready grading machine is for the VM to
have the autodriver executable.  This program assumes that the top
level Makefile for the grading job has been shipped to the VM and
starts the grading sequence from executing that Makefile.

To build a grading vm image for Autolab jobs:

* Create a vm with a stock linux image
* Copy autodriver.c and Makefile to the vm and compile it to autodriver
* Copy autodriver to any common path, make it owned by root wtih setuid bits.
  For example: -rwsr-sr-x 1 root root /usr/bin/autodriver

* Create the following users
  autolab: The ssh/scp user tied with selected key pair of you cloud account
  autograde: The user to run TA's grader starting from the top Makefile (see autodriver.c)
  student: For students to use the exact image for coding/testing

The sequence of grading using the above image is such:

The grading engine: scp top level Makefile and autograde.tar (both
made by course staff), and student's submission to the grading vm.

The grading engine: ssh to run autodriver program.

The greating vm: autodriver program (running as root because of the
setuid bit) starts a child process (running as user autograde) to run
"make" with top level Makefile.

The grading engine: scp the output file from the grading vm.
